        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            Hello! My name is Bryant McGee. I'm a transfer student from Truman College and this is my 3rd semester here at IIT.
            Im currently enrolled in the ITM program and i plan on specializing in IT ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MANAGEMENT.
            Outside of school, i co-operate a clothing boutique with my friend. It's a store based on the south side of Chicago.
            I also have my own photography business where i cover events, do portraits, etc. I love sports, learning about new tech, art,
            and anything creative.
